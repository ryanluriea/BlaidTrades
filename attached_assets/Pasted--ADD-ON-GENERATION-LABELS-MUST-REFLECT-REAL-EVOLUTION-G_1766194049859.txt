🔧 ADD-ON: GENERATION LABELS MUST REFLECT REAL EVOLUTION (GEN 1 → GEN N)
🚨 PROBLEM

Right now, bots are labeled “Gen 1” but:

The label does not reliably update when EVOLVING jobs occur

Users cannot visually confirm that evolution actually happened

This breaks trust in the evolution system and makes progress invisible

If a bot evolves, the generation label must change. Anything else is misleading.

✅ REQUIRED BEHAVIOR (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
1️⃣ GENERATION IS BACKEND TRUTH

Each bot has a canonical generation number (e.g. generation)

Generation increments ONLY when an EVOLVING job completes successfully

Generation must be persisted (DB) — not derived client-side

Example:

Gen 1 → EVOLVING → Gen 2
Gen 2 → EVOLVING → Gen 3

2️⃣ UI MUST REFLECT REAL GENERATION

Wherever the bot is shown (Bots list, detail view, cards):

Replace static labels like:
❌ Gen 1

With:
✅ Gen {bot.generation}

This includes:

Bots table rows

Bot detail header

Any strategy / evolution panels

Tooltips and hover cards

No hardcoded or cached generation values.

3️⃣ EVOLVING BADGE + GENERATION MUST MATCH

When an EVOLVING job is:

Queued / Running

Show badge:
Evolving → Gen {current + 1}

Completed

Badge disappears

Generation label updates immediately

Example:

[Evolving → Gen 3]  (while running)
→ completes
→ label now shows: Gen 3


This provides visual confirmation that evolution actually occurred.

4️⃣ BOTNOW MUST EXPOSE GENERATION CONTEXT

Extend botNow to include:

botNow: {
  state: "EVOLVING_RUNNING" | "EVOLVING_QUEUED" | ...
  generation: number
  evolving?: {
    fromGeneration: number
    toGeneration: number
    iteration?: number
  }
}


UI must not guess — it renders exactly what backend reports.

5️⃣ AUDIT + PROOF (REQUIRED)

Provide proof that generations advance:

SQL

SELECT id, generation, updated_at
FROM bots
ORDER BY updated_at DESC
LIMIT 10;


Jobs

SELECT bot_id, job_type, status, completed_at
FROM bot_jobs
WHERE job_type = 'EVOLVING'
ORDER BY completed_at DESC
LIMIT 10;


Screenshot

Show:

A bot labeled Gen 1

An Evolving → Gen 2 badge

Same bot afterward labeled Gen 2

🎯 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This add-on is complete ONLY when:

Generation number increments after every successful EVOLVING job

UI labels update immediately without refresh hacks

“Gen 1” is no longer static or misleading

Users can visually track long-term evolution progress

Evolution feels real, earned, and provable

🧠 WHY THIS MATTERS

Evolution without visible generations is indistinguishable from randomness.

Generation labels are:

The ledger of progress

The history of learning

The trust anchor for autonomy

If bots are evolving, the UI must prove it.
