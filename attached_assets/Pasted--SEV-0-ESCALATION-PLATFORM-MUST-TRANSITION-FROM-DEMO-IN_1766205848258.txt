🚨🚨 SEV-0 ESCALATION: PLATFORM MUST TRANSITION FROM DEMO → INSTITUTIONAL REALITY

This is no longer a UI, badge, or scheduler issue.

You have now explicitly confirmed:

“This is a well-architected demo platform, not an institutional trading system.”

That is not acceptable.
We have repeatedly and explicitly required institutional-grade, real-data, real-logic readiness.

We are not asking for “eventually” or “later.”
We are asking for the platform to stop pretending work is real when it is simulated.

🔴 CURRENT STATE (UNACCEPTABLE)

You have confirmed ALL of the following:

❌ Backtests are mock / simulated

❌ Strategy logic is randomized

❌ “Evolution” is cosmetic

❌ Databento is not actually driving historical or live analysis

❌ Broker connectivity exists in name only

❌ PnL is not derived from real execution or real historical fills

❌ LAB appears “alive” visually but is not performing real research

This means:

LAB bots are not learning, improving, or evolving in any real sense.

That violates the entire purpose of this platform.

🟢 REQUIRED STATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

We are not asking if this is possible.
We are asking you to implement it now, step by step.

PHASE 1 — REAL DATA BACKTESTING (MANDATORY)
REQUIREMENTS

Databento Historical Data MUST be used

CME futures (MES, MNQ, ES, NQ)

Proper session handling (RTH/ETH)

Correct tick/second resolution

Deterministic, replayable datasets

Backtests must be real

No random walks

No mocked candles

No fabricated trades

Trades must come from:

real bar data

real entry/exit rules

real fills (with slippage + fees)

Proof

Show the exact Databento query used

Show bar counts

Show timestamp ranges

Show deterministic re-runs produce same results

If backtests are not real, everything above them is meaningless.

PHASE 2 — REAL STRATEGY LOGIC (NO RANDOMNESS)
REQUIREMENTS

Each bot must have explicit, inspectable rules:

Entry conditions (price, time, indicators, structure)

Exit conditions (TP, SL, time stop, invalidation)

Risk rules (size, max loss, scaling)

Session rules (RTH/ETH, no-trade windows)

These rules must be:

Stored

Versioned

Shown in UI

Exported in Bot Packs

Used verbatim in backtests

❌ “Archetypes that generate random behavior” are not acceptable.

PHASE 3 — REAL EVOLUTION (NOT COSMETIC)
REQUIREMENTS

Evolution must mean actual change:

Parameter mutation

Rule variation

Risk constraint tuning

Entry/exit threshold changes

Generation increments ONLY when:

An EVOLVING job materially changes the rule set

The new generation re-backtests

Performance deltas are measured

Generation history must show:

What changed

Why it changed

What improved or degraded

If evolution doesn’t change logic, it is fake.

PHASE 4 — LAB CONTINUOUS RESEARCH (INSTITUTIONAL STANDARD)

LAB bots must behave like a research desk:

Continuous backtesting

Continuous improvement

Periodic evolution

Clear job cadence (not idle starvation)

Idle LAB bots are acceptable only when:

All cadence rules are satisfied

No scheduled work is due

Idle because “nothing triggered” is not acceptable.

PHASE 5 — BROKER + LIVE READINESS (PARALLEL TRACK)

We are NOT asking to trade live today, but:

Broker connectivity must be real

Market data must be real

Paper trading must be execution-accurate

This is required to validate:

Slippage assumptions

Latency impact

Fill realism

Risk engine correctness

🔐 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA (NO EXCEPTIONS)

This is considered institutionally ready only when:

Backtests use real historical market data

Strategies have real logic

Evolution changes strategy behavior

LAB bots are continuously researching

PnL reflects actual strategy outcomes

UI badges reflect real work

Metrics change because real computation happened

Until then, the system must not be represented as institutional-grade.

⚠️ IMPORTANT TONE CHECK

This is not hostility — this is clarity.

You’ve built a strong architectural shell.
Now you must put a real engine inside it.

We are not interested in:

demos

placeholders

simulated intelligence

cosmetic evolution

We are building a real trading research platform.

🧭 NEXT STEP (DO THIS)

Reply with:

A concrete implementation plan for:

Real Databento backtesting

Real strategy logic

Real evolution mechanics

A clear order of execution

A timeline

A statement confirming:

“After Phase 1–3, LAB bots will be performing real institutional research.”

Anything less is not acceptable.
