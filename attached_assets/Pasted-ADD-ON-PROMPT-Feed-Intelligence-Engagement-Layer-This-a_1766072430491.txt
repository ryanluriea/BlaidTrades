ADD-ON PROMPT — Feed Intelligence & Engagement Layer

This add-on extends the existing “Feed” without changing its core purpose or scope.

1) Reaction Signals (non-social, analytical)
Each Feed event card should support lightweight reaction signals that are NOT public/social, but analytical:

Supported reactions:
- 👍 PROFITABLE / POSITIVE OUTCOME
- ⚠️ RISK / WARNING
- 🧠 AUTONOMY INSIGHT
- ❌ ERROR / FAILURE

Rules:
- Reactions are optional
- Stored per user (not global counts)
- Used to help the user visually scan outcomes over time
- Reactions must NEVER affect trading logic (display-only)

2) Visual Encoding in the Feed
Feed cards should use subtle, professional visual encoding:
- Green accent → profitable trade / successful outcome
- Red accent → loss / error / kill / failure
- Amber accent → risk block / degraded / warning
- Blue / neutral → informational or lifecycle events

This should be:
- Minimal (no emojis in core UI)
- Consistent with existing design system
- Accessible (contrast-safe)

3) Per-Bot Mini Timelines
Each bot detail page should include a “Recent Activity” mini timeline:
- Last 10–20 Feed events for that bot
- Same event card structure, compact layout
- Clickable → opens the same event detail drawer as the main Feed
- This is NOT a separate data source — it reuses the Feed event model

4) PnL-Aware Highlighting (read-only)
For trade-related Feed events:
- Display realized PnL if available
- Use soft intensity (not large numbers):
  - Strong green → outsized positive outcome
  - Muted green → small win
  - Muted red → small loss
  - Strong red → outsized loss
- No aggregation or analytics logic added here (display-only)

5) Autonomy Intelligence Surfacing
For events tied to autonomy:
- AUTONOMY_TIER_CHANGED
- AUTONOMY_SCORE_UPDATED
- GATE_BLOCKED / GATE_PASSED

Enhancements:
- Small “Autonomy” badge on the Feed card
- Clicking opens the autonomy breakdown drawer
- Show which gates influenced the event (pass/fail snapshot)

6) UX Guardrails
- No fake engagement metrics
- No likes, comments, followers, or social feeds
- This is a system observability + explainability surface, not a social network
- Everything must map to real emitted events

7) Acceptance Proof (additive)
Please include:
- Screenshot of Feed with reaction signals applied
- Screenshot of bot detail mini timeline
- Example trade Feed event with PnL highlighting
- Example autonomy-related Feed event with autonomy drawer opened

This add-on should make the Feed feel:
- Alive
- Explainable
- Trustworthy
- Useful at a glance

Do not expand scope beyond this add-on.
