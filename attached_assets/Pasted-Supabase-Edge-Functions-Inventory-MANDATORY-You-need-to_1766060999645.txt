Supabase Edge Functions Inventory (MANDATORY)

You need to give me a complete, explicit inventory of all Supabase Edge Functions that exist now or previously for this project.

This is a blocking audit step. Do not summarize. Do not infer. Do not describe “likely” functions.

REQUIRED OUTPUT (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Filesystem inventory

List the exact contents of:

supabase/functions/


For each subfolder, provide:

Function name (folder name)

Path to entry file (e.g. index.ts)

Approximate LOC

Last modified commit/hash (if available)

Invocation inventory

Search the entire repo and list every place that invokes an Edge Function:

supabase.functions.invoke(...)

fetch("https://*.functions.supabase.co/...")

Any wrappers/utilities calling edge endpoints

For each call site:

File path

Function name invoked

Purpose of the call

Whether it is still reachable in the current app flow

Responsibility classification
For each Edge Function, classify it as one of:

EXECUTION CRITICAL (starts/stops bots, trades, jobs, risk, kill)

STATE MUTATING (writes to bots, jobs, trades, accounts)

SIDE EFFECT ONLY (webhooks, notifications, logging)

DEAD / UNUSED

Conflict analysis
For each function, explicitly answer:

Does this duplicate logic now implemented in Express?

Does it mutate state that Express also controls?

Could this cause split-brain behavior?

Decision table
Provide a table with:

Function name

Current status (ACTIVE / UNUSED / LEGACY)

Required Supabase secrets (if any)

Recommended action:

KEEP (with justification)

MIGRATE TO EXPRESS

DELETE

HARD CONSTRAINTS

Do not assume Supabase is required unless a function is actively used.

If any Edge Function is EXECUTION CRITICAL, flag it as SEV-1 ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION.

If a function is unused, say DELETE explicitly.

If you are unsure, mark it UNKNOWN and explain why.

GOAL

We are enforcing single-control-plane architecture.

After this step, I will decide:

Whether Supabase keys are needed at all

Whether Edge Functions are removed entirely

Whether anything must be migrated before production

This output must be complete, auditable, and factual.

Proceed.
