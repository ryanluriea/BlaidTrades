Replit — thanks. Confirming scope and updating the directive so we’re aligned.

1) Naming + placement (confirmed)
- The tab SHOULD be called “Feed”.
- This replaces / evolves the existing Fleet-style view into a social-media-style activity feed for bots.
- Feed is the canonical place to see *everything bots do* over time.

2) Purpose of the Feed (not just UI)
The Feed is NOT cosmetic. It is the canonical human-readable projection of real system activity.

The Feed must reflect REAL events emitted by the system, including:
- Trades (entered, exited, rejected)
- “Why traded” and “Why not traded” outcomes
- Bot promotions / demotions
- Graduations
- Runner lifecycle (start, stop, restart, kill)
- Job lifecycle (queued, started, timed out, failed, completed)
- Autonomy tier changes
- Risk blocks / gate failures
- Backtests and lab actions

The Feed UI can be frontend-only, but:
- Events shown must already exist or be emitted by real backend actions
- Each event must be tied to a trace_id
- No fake / placeholder / synthetic events

3) Feed behavior requirements
- Reverse chronological (newest first)
- Infinite scroll
- Event cards grouped by category
- Clickable event → opens a detail drawer
- Detail drawer must support:
  - Copy trace_id
  - Copy job_id (if present)
  - Deep links to:
    • Why Traded
    • Why Not Traded
    • Decision Traces
    • Autonomy Score (if applicable)

4) Filters (confirmed + required)
Filters must work together:
- Time range: 1h / 24h / 7d / 30d / All
- Category:
  • Trading
  • Bot Lifecycle
  • Runners & Jobs
  • Autonomy
  • Backtesting
  • System
- Severity (INFO / WARN / ERROR / CRITICAL)

5) Autonomy visibility
- Bot detail pages must show:
  - Autonomy tier
  - Autonomy score breakdown
  - Gate pass/fail state
- The Feed must surface events for:
  - AUTONOMY_TIER_CHANGED
  - AUTONOMY_SCORE_UPDATED (if applicable)

6) Scope exclusions (important)
- Do NOT work on Discord notifications
- Do NOT work on SMS, Twilio, AWS SNS, or alerts
- This task is Feed + explainability only

7) Acceptance proof required (paste outputs)
Please include copy/paste proof of:

A) Real event emission
- Promote or demote a bot → Feed shows event with trace_id
- Reconcile a bot → Feed shows reconciliation event
- Runner/job lifecycle event → Feed shows timeout / restart / failure
- Trade or no-trade decision → Feed links to decision context

B) Explainability wiring
- From Feed → open event → jump to Why Traded / Why Not Traded
- From Feed → open event → view Autonomy score if relevant

C) Tenant isolation
- Confirm Feed only shows events for the authenticated user

8) Deliverables in your next response
- Files changed (client vs server)
- Screenshot or click path: Dashboard → Feed → Event → Detail drawer
- Example trace_id and where it resolves

Once the Feed is solid and trusted, we’ll revisit notifications later.
