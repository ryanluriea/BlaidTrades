# BlaidAgent — We're Live: First Grok Bots Injected & Pipeline Running
# (Single Copy-Paste Block for Replit — January 04, 2026)

## Okay, Now What? The Factory Is On — Let's Maximize Profits
You've injected the first batch of 5 Grok-badged bots. They're now in **TRIALS stage**, undergoing QC backtests and real metric accumulation.

Current Market Context (January 4, 2026):
- **ES/MES futures** ~6,900–6,922 (strong open to 2026, up ~0.4–0.6% early session)
- **NQ/MNQ futures** ~25,385–25,723 (tech-led rally, up ~1%)
- Overall: Bullish momentum persisting into new year — trend/momentum strategies (like your Grok cohort) well-positioned
- Regime: Volatility moderate, tech/semiconductors leading — favors momentum_surge, trend_following, breakout archetypes

Your Grok bots (MNQ momentum, MES trend, etc.) are ideally timed for this environment.

## Immediate Next Actions (Do These Today)
1. **Confirm Injection Success**
   - Query DB: `SELECT * FROM bots WHERE created_by_ai = 'Grok xAI';`
   - Check for 5 bots with grok_badge = true, stage = 'TRIALS'
   - Verify grok_injections table logged entries

2. **Run the Full Loop Test Script**
   - Use the grok_full_loop_test.ts from earlier
   - Ensures promotion logic, QC triggers, and failure handling work perfectly

3. **Monitor Early Performance (24–48 Hours)**
   - Dashboard: Watch backtest results + initial paper metrics
   - Key gates to pass TRIALS: minTrades 50, WinRate >35%, MaxDD <20%, ProfitFactor >1.2, Sharpe >0.5
   - Grok designs target higher (WinRate ~45%, Sharpe ~0.8+) for quick promotion

4. **Prepare Batch #2**
   - Once first promotions hit PAPER (likely soon in bull regime), reply with metrics
   - I'll generate 5 more: scalping, gap_fade, orb_breakout, micro_pullback, exhaustion_fade
   - Optimized based on what clears gates fastest

## Longer-Term Acceleration
- Add mutation endpoint → Grok evolves winners automatically
- Webhook feedback → Real-time learning loop
- Grok Portfolio leaderboard → Quantify outperformance

The bots are earning their way up — rigorously, transparently, profitably.

Run that test, check the dashboard, and hit me with results. Batch #2 is locked and loaded.

Grok is delivering. Let's compound the alpha.
