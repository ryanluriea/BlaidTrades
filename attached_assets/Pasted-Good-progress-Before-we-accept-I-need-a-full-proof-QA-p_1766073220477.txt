Good progress. Before we accept, I need a full proof + QA pack (no summaries without evidence). Please deliver the following:

1) EXACT FILES CHANGED (UI-only)
- List every file modified/added with a short purpose line for each.
- Confirm: NO changes to server/, shared/, client/src/hooks/ for this Feed Intelligence pass.

2) “FEED” NAMING + NAV CONSISTENCY
- Confirm it is labeled “Feed” everywhere in nav + page titles (no “Fleet” wording left in the UI).
- Provide grep output proving no “Fleet tab now…” language remains in UI labels.

3) REACTION SIGNALS (must be analytical + per-user)
- Where are reactions stored right now?
  - If not stored yet: mark as UI-only + add TODO with disabled persistence (don’t fake it).
  - If stored: show schema/endpoint used and confirm it’s per-user and NOT global counts.
- Provide one screenshot showing reactions applied on an event and persisted after refresh.

4) VISUAL ENCODING RULES (deterministic)
- Provide the exact mapping table used in code:
  - event_type → accent color
  - severity → accent override (if any)
  - trade outcome (PnL) → intensity rules
- Provide screenshots showing:
  - a profitable trade
  - a losing trade
  - an autonomy event
  - a warning/risk block
  - a kill/error

5) PnL HIGHLIGHTING SAFETY
- Confirm PnL shown is REALIZED only (not unrealized).
- Confirm currency formatting + sign handling is consistent.
- Confirm no trading logic depends on UI styling.

6) BOT MINI TIMELINE INTEGRATION
- Show where BotMiniTimeline is mounted (file + line reference).
- Confirm it reuses the SAME drawer component and SAME event model as the main Feed (no parallel logic).
- Provide screenshot of bot detail mini timeline + opening the event drawer from it.

7) AUTONOMY BADGES + DEEP LINKS
- Confirm autonomy badges appear only for autonomy-related event types (list them).
- Provide screenshot of clicking an autonomy event badge and landing on the bot’s autonomy view.

8) REGRESSION CHECKS
- Run TypeScript build / lint and confirm PASS.
- Confirm no console errors in browser on Feed page.
- Confirm long JSON payload in drawer is scroll-safe and doesn’t freeze UI.

9) PERFORMANCE QUICK CHECK
- What’s the query shape for the feed (paging, limit, time range)?
- Confirm the Feed does not render unbounded lists (must paginate or virtualize if large).

Deliverables:  
A) Screenshots for each proof item above  
B) Short “QA steps I ran” list  
C) Final status: ACCEPT / BLOCKED with specific blockers
