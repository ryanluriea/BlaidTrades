the threshold for QC is 90 so why are some that are 90+ in review and not QC?

Good question. Let me check the auto-trigger logic to see why candidates meeting the 90+ threshold aren't being automatically queued for QC verification.

I found the issue. The auto-trigger worker is checking for disposition = "SENT_TO_LAB" but candidates in the Review tab have disposition = NULL. The worker is looking at the wrong disposition state.

Let me fix this:

Now I also need to update the auto-trigger to set the disposition to QUEUED_FOR_QC when it queues a candidate:

Fixed the issue. The auto-trigger worker was looking for candidates with disposition = "SENT_TO_LAB" (already promoted), but candidates in the Review tab have NULL disposition.

Changes made:

Fixed the auto-trigger worker to look for candidates with NULL disposition (Review tab candidates)
Added automatic update to set disposition = "QUEUED_FOR_QC" when a candidate is auto-triggered, moving it to the QC Testing tab
Now candidates meeting your 90% threshold will automatically be:

Picked up by the auto-trigger worker (runs every 5 minutes)
Queued for QC verification
Moved to the QC Testing tab
The server is now running. The next auto-trigger cycle should move eligible 90+ candidates from Review to QC Testing.
