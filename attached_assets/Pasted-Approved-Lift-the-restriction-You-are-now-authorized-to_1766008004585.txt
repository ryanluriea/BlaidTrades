Approved. Lift the restriction.

You are now authorized to modify files under client/src/hooks/** for the sole purpose of completing the Supabase → Express API migration required for institutional readiness.

NON-NEGOTIABLE SCOPE:
ALLOWED:
- Replace Supabase client queries with fetch(credentials: 'include') calls to the existing Express endpoints
- Enforce server-authoritative filtering (no client-side ownership/stage enforcement)
- Add response.ok checks and structured error propagation
- Fix React Query keys and cache invalidation to match Express routes
- Ensure default trade filters: is_invalid = false AND source_type != 'TEST'
- Fail closed: missing/errored data must surface explicit error states (not empty arrays)

NOT ALLOWED:
- No architectural rewrites
- No renaming or changing hook public signatures unless strictly required
- No UI redesign or component refactors
- No changes to packages/core risk or PnL logic
- No introduction of new state management frameworks

EXECUTION ORDER (MANDATORY):
1) SEV-1 hooks first:
   - Trading lifecycle (useTrading, trades, open positions, events feed)
   - Jobs / runs lifecycle (creation, heartbeat, terminalization)
   - Runner control (start / restart / reconcile)
   - Bot lifecycle (instances, status, kill/resurrect awareness)
2) SEV-2 hooks
3) SEV-3 hooks

FOR EACH BATCH:
- Work on a dedicated branch (e.g., hook-migration-sev1)
- Provide a list of hooks migrated (file paths)
- Provide endpoint mapping (hook → API routes)
- Run and report verification:
  a) Provider failure → DEGRADED/BLOCKED (no fabricated trades/PnL)
  b) Backtest/job reaches terminal state (no stuck RUNNING)
  c) Cross-account isolation (including >50 row scenario)
  d) PnL parity: backend == UI for a selected bot instance
- Update AUDIT_FINDINGS.md with migrated count, remaining count, and any Sev-1 gaps

QUALITY BAR:
- If an Express endpoint cannot fully meet the contract, return 501 Not Implemented with a structured error and mark it Sev-1.
- No silent failures. No fake data. No partial success responses.

Proceed now with SEV-1 hook migration in a single PR.
