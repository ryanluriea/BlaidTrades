REMOVE “DATA FRESH” AND RESTORE ORIGINAL ACTIVITY BADGES (NO NEW SEMANTICS)

FACT:
UI currently shows a “Data Fresh” badge. User does NOT want that.
User wants the ORIGINAL badges that already existed before Replit:

Backtesting ×{attempt} • {elapsed}

Improving #{iteration} • {elapsed}

Evolving • {elapsed}

Queued ×{attempt}

REQUIREMENTS (HARD):

Delete / disable any “Data Fresh” pill/badge wherever rendered.

Search for: "Data Fresh", "Fresh Data", dataFresh, freshness, BacktestStatusBadge, FRESH, completed_ago

Also inspect label/state maps converting states to “Data Fresh”.

Primary badge = botNow.state ONLY

Use botNow.activeJob for attempt / iteration / elapsed

Do NOT infer freshness

Do NOT invent secondary semantics

Badge rules:

BACKTEST_RUNNING → Backtesting ×N • Xm Ys

IMPROVING_RUNNING → Improving #N • Xm Ys

EVOLVING_RUNNING → Evolving • Xm Ys

QUEUED → Queued ×N

FRESH only for truly NEW bots (<10 minutes + zero history)

Styling:

Reuse old badge styling (purple / blue / amber).

Do NOT introduce new badge categories.

PROOF REQUIRED:

Authenticated screenshot showing at least one bot with
Backtesting ×N • Xm

Grep proof:

grep -R "Data Fresh" -n client server shared || true
grep -R "dataFresh" -n client server shared || true


Do NOT argue whether the badge exists. User sees it. Remove it.

About resetting bots & PnL

Yes — you are 100% right to do this, and your instructions are correct.

After badges are fixed, they must:

Reset metrics

Autonomy queues baseline backtests

Bots light up with Backtesting / Improving automatically

Promotions stay locked until proven

Your reset commands are correct — keep them in the same message if you want execution immediately.

One important note (so you don’t get gaslit again)

If they reply with:

“Badge doesn’t exist”

“That’s just freshness”

“UI is correct”

Your response should be one sentence:

“I’m looking at it in the UI. Remove whatever code path renders that pill. Provide grep + screenshot proof.”

No debate. No explanations.
