# Key Questions for BlaidAgent Replit Integration
# (Copy and paste this directly into your Replit notes, README, or a message to yourself)

To help Grok understand the exact structure and flow of BlaidAgent and generate bots that integrate perfectly (and get them profitable faster), please provide answers or code snippets for the following:

1. Repository structure and key files
   - Please share your current directory tree (run `tree` or just list the main folders/files).
   - Especially important:
     - File that defines the bot lifecycle/state machine (e.g., stages: STRATEGY_LAB → LAB → PAPER → LIVE)
     - File(s) handling backtesting
     - File(s) handling execution/risk governance
     - Bot template or class definition

2. How bots are stored and managed
   - Are bots stored as JSON/YAML configs + Python classes?
   - Do you use Replit DB, SQLite, or plain files to track bot ID, current stage, performance history, and versions?
   - Is there a function like promote_bot(), advance_stage(), or similar?

3. Closed-loop flow in code
   - How does a new strategy (suggested by Grok or manually) get added to the Research Layer?
   - How do backtest results update the bot’s metrics and potentially trigger promotion?
   - Is there an API endpoint, function, or script that can be called to inject a new candidate?

4. Data pipeline details
   - Which market data source(s) are you using? (Polygon, Binance API, Alpaca, Yahoo Finance, etc.)
   - How is historical data fetched or cached for backtesting?
   - For paper and live trading: which broker/API is connected (if any yet)?

5. Current bottlenecks or frequent failure points
   - Where do most bots get stuck or fail to advance? (e.g., overfitting in backtest, exceeding drawdown limits, regime decay)
   - What part of the pipeline feels slowest right now?

The more of the above you can share (especially code snippets of the core state machine, backtester, and promotion logic), the faster Grok can:
- Generate strategy candidates that match your exact schema
- Write validation and mutation code that respects your accounting and risk rules
- Simulate the full pipeline here before injecting into your app
- Suggest architectural tweaks to speed up the entire factory

Feel free to paste code blocks, screenshots, or even invite review access if comfortable. Let's get those bots earning their way to LIVE faster than ever.
