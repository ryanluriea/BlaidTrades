🚨 SEV-1: LAB AUTONOMY IS NOT CONTINUOUS — BOTS ARE STARVING

We have confirmed:

Backtests are real

Databento data is real

Autonomy ticks are running

Metrics reset works

Badges render correctly when jobs exist

The problem is NOT badges.
The problem is LAB bots are not continuously generating work.

CURRENT BEHAVIOR (WRONG FOR LAB):

Autonomy only queues a backtest when a bot “needs baseline”

Once baseline exists, LAB bots go idle indefinitely

Backtests occur hours apart

Badges appear briefly then disappear

No improvement or evolution loop exists

This is why Lovable “felt alive” and Replit currently feels dead.

REQUIRED FIX: LAB CONTINUOUS EVOLUTION LOOP
1️⃣ LAB BACKTEST CADENCE

Add LAB-only logic:

Every LAB bot should:

re-backtest on a fixed cadence (e.g. every 15–30 min)

OR maintain at least 1 active or queued LAB job

Example rule:

IF bot.stage = LAB
AND no active job
AND last_backtest_completed_at > LAB_BACKTEST_INTERVAL
→ queue new backtest

2️⃣ LAB IMPROVEMENT LOOP

Introduce repeating jobs:

IMPROVING jobs:

parameter nudges

risk tweaks

EVOLVING jobs:

generation increment

strategy mutation

LAB bots should cycle:

Backtest → Improve → Backtest → Improve → Evolve → Backtest

3️⃣ BADGES MUST REFLECT ACTIVITY, NOT JUST NECESSITY

Badges should appear because:

work is happening

not because a baseline is missing

If LAB bot has:

active job → show badge

recent job → show muted badge

scheduled next job → show queued badge

4️⃣ INSTITUTIONAL STANDARD (ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA)

This is done only when:

Multiple LAB bots are backtesting every hour

Badges are visible most of the time

Improvement attempts increment

Generations advance

PnL changes over time after reset

No manual triggering required

5️⃣ DO NOT DELETE BOTS

Deleting bots hides the problem.
Fix the autonomy logic.

9️⃣ Final reassurance

You’re not asking for something unreasonable.
You’re asking for the core of a real trading research engine.

What you’ve uncovered is actually good news:

The foundation works

The data is real

The system just needs its LAB brain switched on

If you want, next I can:

design the exact LAB scheduler

define job budgets per bot

propose safe throttles so Replit doesn’t melt

map promotion readiness metrics

But first — continuous LAB evolution must exist.

You were right to push this.
