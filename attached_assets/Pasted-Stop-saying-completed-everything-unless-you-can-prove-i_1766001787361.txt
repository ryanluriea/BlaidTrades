Stop saying “completed everything” unless you can prove it.

1) DEFINITIVE INVENTORY (NO HANDWAVING)
- Produce a machine-generated list of ALL remaining Supabase-dependent hooks/files.
  - Command output required (rg/grep results) with file paths.
  - Group them by domain: Evolution, Strategy Lab, Risk/Kill Engine, Autonomy, Integrations, Accounts, Trading, etc.
- Then produce a list of ALL Express-migrated hooks with their endpoints.

2) INSTITUTIONAL READINESS = EVIDENCE, NOT OPINION
Provide an “Institutional Readiness Evidence Report” with:
A) Data integrity
- Show the single source of truth for PnL/equity/positions in code (file paths).
- Demonstrate frontend does NOT recompute PnL (or if it does, identify and remove/disable).
- Confirm trade filtering rules are enforced BOTH:
  - at the API query layer AND
  - at any remaining Supabase query layer (if any still exist).
B) No fake data proof
- Global search results for known fake patterns (hardcoded price/pnl, default 21000, placeholder fills, etc.)
- List any fallback code paths that “guess” values and convert them to fail-closed (BLOCKED/DEGRADED).
C) No silent failures proof
- Identify the canonical bot/backtest “run record” table/model.
- Show the FSM implementation status:
  - states present
  - heartbeat update location
  - timeout mechanism
  - terminalization rules
- If FSM is not fully enforced, label this as Sev-1 and state what remains.

3) REQUIRED VERIFICATION TESTS (RUN THEM NOW)
Run and document results (screenshots/log snippets acceptable):
- Test 1: Create a backtest, confirm it reaches a terminal state within a bounded time.
- Test 2: Force a data-provider failure (simulate missing entitlement / rate limit) and verify:
  - state becomes DEGRADED/BLOCKED
  - UI surfaces the reason
  - no fabricated trades/pnl appear
- Test 3: Cross-account data isolation:
  - confirm /api/trades/open cannot leak another account’s trades even >50 rows
- Test 4: PnL divergence check:
  - pick one bot instance
  - compute backend PnL and confirm UI matches exactly (same rounding)

4) HARD REQUIREMENTS FOR “COMPLETED EVERYTHING”
You may only claim “completed everything” when:
- Remaining Supabase hooks = 0 OR explicitly justified and non-critical (with plan)
- Trading/bot lifecycle/risk/evolution paths are fully Express-backed or fully audited for parity
- FSM/timeout/terminalization is enforced for all job types (not just documented)
- UI-only Lovable merge guard is active in GitHub Actions and demonstrated with a failing PR test

5) DELIVERABLES
- Link to the latest checkpoint/commit hash
- List of changed files in this session
- Updated AUDIT_FINDINGS.md with current counts:
  - migrated hooks count
  - remaining hooks count
  - open Sev-1 items (must be 0 to claim institutional-ready)

Proceed in this order: Inventory → Evidence report → Run tests → Update audit.
No more “ready” statements until the report + tests are done.
