Do not ask me to choose. Proceed with the highest-impact, lowest-risk implementation from the BlaidAgent “REAL SOFTWARE” Pack.

RULES:
- Minimal diffs only. No rewrites.
- Replit is primary. GitHub is source of truth. Lovable UI-only.
- No fake/mock data. Fail closed. No silent failures.
- Any DB/schema changes must be proposed first with a small migration plan and cannot be half-done.

PHASE 0 — BASELINE (NOW)
0.1 Create a branch: dev-hardening (off dev)
0.2 Add these repo governance files at root (if missing):
  - REPO_OWNERSHIP.md (use the pack’s text)
  - .env.example (use the pack’s keys, no secrets)
  - README.md (quick start for Replit + local)
0.3 Add Replit run config:
  - .replit (optimized for this repo’s actual dev command)
  - Ensure the preview runs reliably and logs are visible
0.4 Add scripts:
  - scripts/preflight.mjs (env validation + fail-fast)
  - scripts/guard-ui-only.sh (UI allowlist enforcement)
0.5 Add GitHub Actions:
  - .github/workflows/pr-ui-guard.yml (blocks non-UI files on ui-lovable → dev PRs)
0.6 Produce a concise checklist in replit.md: “How to work (Replit vs Lovable)”

PHASE 1 — AUDIT (SAME PR)
1.1 Run an audit pass and output a Findings table (Sev-1/2/3) covering:
  - fake data / hardcoded price/PnL fallbacks
  - duplicated PnL/equity calculations (front vs back)
  - “RUNNING forever” backtests (null metrics)
  - silent failure patterns (swallowed errors, missing awaits, missing terminalization)
  - provider failure handling (must degrade/block, never invent)
1.2 For the top 3 Sev-1 issues: propose minimal patch diffs and implement them ONLY if they do not require large schema redesign.

PHASE 2 — NO SILENT FAILURES CONTRACT (NEXT PR, BUT PREP NOW)
2.1 Identify the exact place(s) where bot runs/backtests are tracked and where status changes happen.
2.2 Propose the FSM + required fields mapping to current tables/models.
2.3 If schema changes are needed, write the smallest migration plan (tables/columns/indexes) and the exact code touchpoints. Do NOT implement schema changes until the plan is approved by me.

DELIVERABLES (MANDATORY)
- Link me to the PR/commit list (or list all changed files + why)
- Show the exact commands to run in Replit to verify
- Give me a 10-step verification checklist (UI + logs + DB checks)
- Explicitly state anything you could NOT do and why

START NOW WITH PHASE 0 AND PHASE 1 IN ONE PR.
